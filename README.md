**AF.AgentFramework** is an experimental .NET framework for building **agents** and **multi-agent systems (MAS)**.
It‚Äôs a personal learning project ‚Äî but I expect it to also grow into a fully-fledged framework for others who want to both explore/learn agent-based architectures in C#/.NET and to build agentic systems for production.

The framework is rooted in **agent theory and MAS research**. My goal is to create clean, theory-aligned abstractions for:
- **Kernel** ‚Äì the minimal agent core
- **Engines** ‚Äì execution models (loop, reactive, etc.)
- **Runners** ‚Äì input adapters that generates engine "ticks"
- **Tools** ‚Äì agent-usable capabilities, e.g. external actions
- **Hosting** ‚Äì integration with .NET GenericHost and application lifecycles
- **MAS** ‚Äì support for multi-agent collaboration using blackboards and agent directories

## Why?

There are many frameworks for creating agentic systems, like e.g. langgraph, openai swarm, etc. just to name a couple. What I think they all lack is alignment with the agentic theory. At least if you are new to agentic architectures and are starting out.

I want to **bridge theory and practice** ‚Äî building a framework that is simple enough to learn from, yet solid enough to use for real projects.

This repository is where I‚Äôm exploring:
- How agentic abstractions map to practical agent architectures, integrating with and using .NET patterns
- How concepts like **MAPE-K, Tools/Actuators, Policies, MAS and Agent Societies** can be implemented in code

## Current Status

üöß **Work in Progress** üöß Right now the focus is on:
- Laying down scaffolding and core abstractions (the theory "spine")
- Adding all the base modules (Kernel, Engines, Runners, Hosting, Tools, MultiAgent)
- Building minimal examples (e.g. `HelloLoopAgent`, `HelloMapeAgent`, and `HelloReactiveAgent`) all running together in the `HelloKernel` sample

APIs are **not stable yet**. Expect things to change as I refine the abstractions.

## Live Dashboard

When running the included **HelloKernel** sample (with `HelloLoopAgent`, `HelloReactiveAgent`, and `HelloMapeAgent`),
you can open the minimal built-in dashboard at [http://localhost:6060/af](http://localhost:6060/af)
to observe agent activity and kernel state in real time.

  <img src="docs/images/dashboard-sample.png" alt="AF.AgentFramework Dashboard showing live agent metrics" width="800">
</p>

The dashboard is powered by the framework‚Äôs own **ObservabilityServer**, exposing live metrics from the kernel
through a lightweight HTTP interface. It visualizes throughput, queue depth, utilization, and per-agent status updates.

## HelloKernel Sample

The `HelloKernel` project demonstrates how multiple agents and engines run together
in a single host ‚Äî including **loop**, **reactive**, and **MAPE-K** agents.

```csharp
using AgentFramework.Engines.Loop;
using AgentFramework.Engines.Reactive;
using AgentFramework.Hosting;
using AgentFramework.Kernel;
using AgentFramework.Kernel.Policies.Defaults;
using AgentFramework.Runners.Timers;

namespace HelloKernel;

internal class Program
{
    private static async Task Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("HelloKernel sample starting‚Ä¶");

        var policyDefaults = PolicySetDefaults.Create(
            retry: RetryOptions.Default with { MaxAttempts = 2 },
            timeout: new TimeoutOptions(null),
            scheduling: new TimeSliceAwareSchedulingPolicy()
        );

        // Build and run a minimal multi-agent host
        var host = AgentHostBuilder.Create()
            .WithKernelDefaults(policyDefaults)
            .WithKernel(() => new InProcKernelFactory())
            // loop family
            .AddEngine("loop", () => new LoopEngine("loop"))
            .AddRunner("loop", () => new TimerRunner(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(0.7), "Loop Tick"))
            .AddAgent("hello-loop", () => new HelloLoopAgent())
            .AddAgent("hello-mape", () => new HelloMapeAgent())
            .Attach("hello-loop", "loop")
            .Attach("hello-mape", "loop")
            // reactive family
            .AddEngine("reactive", () => new ReactiveEngine("reactive"))
            .AddRunner("reactive", () => new HttpMockRunner())
            .AddAgent("hello-reactive", () => new HelloReactiveAgent())
            .Attach("hello-reactive", "reactive")
            .EnableDashboard(6060)
            .Build();

        await host.RunConsoleAsync();

        Console.WriteLine("HelloKernel sample finished.");
    }
}
```

üß© Try running it ‚Äî then open the [dashboard](http://localhost:6060/af) to see all agents executing live.

## Roadmap

This is a growing list and subject to change as we go and learn.

### üß± Foundation
