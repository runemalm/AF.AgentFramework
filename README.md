**AF.AgentFramework** is an experimental .NET framework for building **agents** and, eventually, **multi-agent systems (MAS)**.      
It‚Äôs a personal learning project ‚Äî but also intended to grow into a reusable toolkit for others who want to explore agent-based architectures in C#/.NET.

The framework is rooted in **agent theory and MAS research**. My goal is to create clean, theory-aligned abstractions for:
- **Kernel** ‚Äì the minimal agent core
- **Engines** ‚Äì execution models (loop, reactive, etc.)
- **Runners** ‚Äì input/output adapters that connect agents to their environment
- **Tools** ‚Äì agent-usable capabilities, e.g. external actions
- **Hosting** ‚Äì integration with .NET GenericHost and application lifecycles
- **MAS** ‚Äì (planned) support for multi-agent collaboration

## Why?

Agents and MAS have been studied for decades in AI research, but they‚Äôre rarely accessible to everyday .NET developers.      
I want to **bridge theory and practice** ‚Äî building a framework that is simple enough to learn from, yet solid enough to use for real projects.

This repository is where I‚Äôm exploring:
- How agentic abstractions map to practical .NET patterns
- How concepts like **roles, policies, perception, and action** can be modeled in code
- How multi-agent collaboration can be layered on top of a clean agent kernel

---

## Current Status

üöß **Work in Progress** üöß Right now the focus is on:
- Laying down scaffolding and core abstractions
- Building minimal examples (e.g. `HelloKernel`)
- Experimenting with agent engines and failure policies

APIs are **not stable yet**. Expect things to change as I refine the abstractions.

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic agent kernel scaffold
- [x] Loop and reactive engines scaffold
- [x] Tools (agent-usable capabilities, e.g. external actions) scaffold
- [ ] MAPE-K execution semantics through loop engine profile scaffold
- [ ] MAS primitives (blackboard, directories, collaboration) scaffold
- [ ] Runner ecosystem (e.g. Slack, timers, HTTP ingress) scaffold
- [ ] Documentation site (DocFX) scaffold
- [ ] Fully implement all of above scaffolding
- [ ] First public v1.0.0 NuGet release

*I‚Äôm building AF.AgentFramework to learn, but also hoping it can become a useful resource for others who want to explore agent-based architectures in .NET. If that sounds interesting, please give it a star and follow along!*
